A Dimension

A dimension is the lens through which you are looking at your data. It is the way you “categorize” the data. The most common dimension is, arguably, time. For example, if I am looking at sales by month in 2015, then the dimension is the months of the year 2015. However, you can categorize data in non-chronological ways as well: for example, if I am looking at GDP by country, then the dimension is country.

The dimension adds context to your measure and helps you to better understand what your data means.

A Measure

The measure is the easy part. This is the numerical values that quantify the data set that you are digging into to understand better. So if you are looking at sales by employee, then “sales” is the measure and employees are the dimension.
